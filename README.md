# MuLinux

MuLinux was an Italian, English-language lightweight Linux distribution maintained by mathematics and physics professor Michele Andreoli, meant to allow very old and obsolete computers (80386, 80486 and Pentium Pro hardware dating from 1986 through 1998) to be used as basic intranet/Internet servers or text-based workstations with a UNIX-like operating system. It was also designed for quickly turning any 80386 or later computer into a temporary, powerful Linux machine, along with system repair, education, forensic analysis and what the developer called proselytizing. In 2004 reviewer Paul Zimmer wrote, "Although there are several other single-floppy Linux distributions, none can match MuLinux's extensive and unique combination of useful features." The last version update was in 2004, when further development of this "linux-on-a-floppy" distribution ended.

# PTSource MuLinux

PTSource Mulinux is a dedicated initiative focused on maintaining and sustaining the legacy of Michele Andreoli's MuLinux project. MuLinux, renowned for its minimalistic design, is a lightweight, flexible Linux distribution that can run on older hardware with limited resources. PTMulinux aims to preserve this valuable piece of open-source history by updating and improving the existing MuLinux codebase, ensuring compatibility with modern systems while retaining its original simplicity and efficiency. The project also emphasizes community engagement, encouraging contributions and support to keep the spirit of MuLinux alive for future generations of users and developers.
